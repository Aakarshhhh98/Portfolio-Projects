# Portfolio-Projects
If you are here you must have come across my Resume. 
My portfolio project folder, not only contains the portfolio projects you see on my resume.
Its a curiosity driven attempt to learn python and solve real world problems. 
The Goal of this folder is to have all the attempts i've had to try out new stuffs with python.  
I belive Learning is continous and never-ending. 
Happy Learning!
